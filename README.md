## About 
This repo provides optimizers  not yet available in PyTorch and some custom examples.
Great for anyone wanting to build their own or explore other options.


## Intro
-**SPSA**: Standard Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation implementation.

-**GuidedSA**: Novel physics-inspired optimizer for scalable high-dimensional black-box optimization.
